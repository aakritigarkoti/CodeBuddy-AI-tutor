# ü§ñ CodeBuddy - Your AI Coding Companion

**CodeBuddy** is an intelligent, multi-modal AI agent designed to make technical learning more interactive, visual, and intuitive. Built using **Streamlit** and powered by **Google Gemini**, it serves as your 24/7 personal coding tutor ‚Äî explaining complex topics through a combination of **text, examples, and diagrams**.

---

## üìö Project Overview

Learning to code can be overwhelming ‚Äî especially when online resources are either too vague or too complex. **CodeBuddy** solves this by offering structured answers broken into **4 major parts**:

1. **Concise Concept Summary**
2. **Real-world Example**
3. **Diagram/Visual Representation**
4. **Clean Code Snippet**

This format ensures deep conceptual clarity for both beginners and intermediates.

This project was developed as part of the **DT Fellowship Simulation** under the "Build Your Own AI Agent" challenge.

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ **Smart Prompt Analysis:** Understands user‚Äôs coding-related query and decides how to respond effectively.

‚úÖ **Structured Answers in 4 Parts:** Auto-generates:
- Concept summary
- Real-world analogy
- Diagram or image
- Code snippet

‚úÖ **Diagram Support with MermaidJS:** Explains logic visually using flowcharts and diagrams.

‚úÖ **Image Search using Pexels API:** Instead of generating, CodeBuddy smartly searches high-quality free images related to the concept.

‚úÖ **Session Memory:** Keeps track of conversation using `st.session_state`.

‚úÖ **Export to PDF:** Users can export the latest answer for revision or notes.

‚úÖ **Clean & Responsive UI:** Streamlit-based interface with clear chat layout and sidebar instructions.

## üß™ Development Journey & Challenges Faced

Building CodeBuddy was not just coding ‚Äî it was about solving **real developer problems** under resource and time constraints. Here's a breakdown:

---

### üîÅ Pivoting from OpenAI to Gemini

**Initial Plan:** We started with OpenAI (GPT-4) for high-quality responses.

**Challenge:** It required a paid subscription and strict API quotas, which was not suitable for a free, student-level assignment.

**Solution:** Switched to **Google Gemini**, which provides a generous free tier and excellent multimodal support. The transition involved:

- Rewriting prompts for Gemini
- Adapting input/output formatting
- Testing Gemini's capabilities for educational content

---

### üñºÔ∏è Diagram & Visual Explanation ‚Äì 3 Attempts

Our goal was to **include visuals** for every concept. This took **3 iterations**:

#### 1. MermaidJS Diagrams (‚úÖ Finalized)
- Used for flowcharts and logic-based topics (e.g., recursion, loops).
- Required correct Markdown formatting (` ```mermaid `).
- Gemini was guided to generate diagram code in proper syntax.

#### 2. AI Image Generation with Imagen (‚ùå Dropped)
- Tried using Google‚Äôs **Imagen model** via Vertex AI.
- Worked well for generating custom diagrams.
- But needed a **billing-enabled GCP account**, which conflicted with our goal of making the app free and simple for everyone.

#### 3. Smart Image Search (‚úÖ Final Choice)
- Gemini generates a **smart image search prompt** (like ‚Äústack vs heap memory diagram‚Äù) which we feed to **Pexels API**.
- The images are relevant and legally free.
- Perfect balance between visual clarity and accessibility.

---

### üé§ Voice Input Attempt (‚ùå Dropped)

**Idea:** Make the app more accessible with voice-to-text input using:

- `SpeechRecognition`, `streamlit-mic-recorder`, `pydub`

**Problem:** These required `FFmpeg` installation and setting PATH manually, especially hard on Windows.

**Decision:** We dropped the voice feature to **keep setup simple**, avoiding any external tools.

---

## üí° Design Philosophy

- **100% Free:** Every tool and API used is free and open-source.
- **Minimal Setup:** No system-level dependencies. Just clone and run.
- **Multi-modal Learning:** Text + Visuals + Code = Deep Understanding
- **Beginner Friendly:** Clean UI and well-structured responses.
